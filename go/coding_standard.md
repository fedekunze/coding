# Tendermint Coding Standard

In order to keep our code looking good with lots of programmers working on it, it helps to have a "coding standard", so all the code generally looks quite similar. This doesn't mean there is only one "right way" to write code, or even that this standard is better than your style.  But if we agree to a number of stylistic practices, it makes it much easier to read and modify new code.

Please add items here, or modify them as appropriate. We have git versioning, don't be afraid of change.

 1. Use `gofmt` (or `goimport`) to format all code upon saving it
 2. Use a linter (see below) and generally try to keep the linter happy (where it makes sense)
 3. Think about documentation, and try to leave godoc comments, when it will help new developers.
 4. Avoid the use of `TODO` / `BUG` / `FIXME` / `XXX` in code; these should instead be documented as specific issues that can be linked to in the code.

## Git

 * Production repos never push to `master` or `develop` branches
 * New features should be written in new branches and pull request opened to the `develop` branch
 * Merging from `develop` to `master` happens during a release.
 * All branches should be in lowercase, underscores are okay in branch names
 * All pull requests should include any relevant additions to the `CHANGELOG.md`, If PR is to the develop branch changes
 can be included under an `unreleased changes` header at the top of the document.

## Linters

These must be applied to all (go) repos.

 * [shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck)
 * [gometalinter (covers all important linters)](https://github.com/alecthomas/gometalinter)
   - see the `Makefile` in each repo for ongoing linting progress. Running `make metalinter` is the ultimate goal, while `make metalinter_test` enables all the linters that are currently passing, for integration with CI.

## Documentation

Every package should have a high level `doc.go` file to describe the purpose of that package, its main functions, and any other relevant information.

## Various

 * Reserve "Save" and "Load" for long-running persistence operations. When parsing bytes, use "Read" or "Write".
 * Avoid single letter variable names, be more descriptive, and try to maintain consistency across the codebase. Note: this conflicts with https://talks.golang.org/2014/names.slide#7
 * Do not use "instance" in function names
 * A struct generally shouldnâ€™t have a field named after itself, aka. this shouldn't occur:
``` golang
type middleware struct {
	middleware Middleware
}
```
 * In comments, use "iff" to mean, "if and only if".  (It's not a typo)
 * Product names are capitalized, like "Tendermint", "Basecoin", "Protobuf", etc except in command lines: `tendermint --help`
 * The first letter of sentences in comments are capitalized
 * Acronyms are all capitalized, like "RPC", "gRPC", "API".  "MyID", rather than "MyId"
 * Receiver variables should be at least 2 letters.  e.g. not `func (s \*Something) MyFunc(){}` but `func (sm *Something) MyFunc(){}`.  This makes refactoring easier when we rename Something to something else.

## Importing Libraries

Sometimes it's necessary to rename libraries to avoid naming collisions or ambiguity.

 * Use [goimports](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports)
 * Separate imports into blocks - one for the standard lib and one for others. In some cases, it's nice to
 separate into three: standard lib, external libs, tendermint libs.
 * Here are some common library labels for consistency:
   - dbm "github.com/tendermint/tmlibs/db"
   - cmn "github.com/tendermint/tmlibs/common"
   - tmcmd "github.com/tendermint/tendermint/cmd/tendermint/commands"
   - tmcfg "github.com/tendermint/tendermint/config/tendermint"
   - tmtypes "github.com/tendermint/tendermint/types"
 * Avoid using anonymous imports (the `.`), for example, `tmlibs/common` or anything else.
 * tip: Use the `_` library import to import a library for initialization effects (side effects)

## Dependencies

 * Use [glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide)
 * Never edit the glide.lock file, instead if you need to lock a dependancy to a certain git hash, the `version` can
 be set to the desired hash. For more information on advanced usage of the `glide.yaml` file see
[this](https://glide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/glide.yaml/).
 * Dependencies should be pinned by a release tag, or specific commit, to avoid breaking `go get` when external dependencies are updated.

## Testing

 * The first rule of testing is: we add tests to our code
 * The second rule of testing is: we add tests to our code
 * For Golang testing:
   * Make use of table driven testing where possible and not-cumbersome
     - [Inspiration](https://dave.cheney.net/2013/06/09/writing-table-driven-tests-in-go)
   * Make use of [assert](https://godoc.org/github.com/stretchr/testify/assert) and [require](https://godoc.org/github.com/stretchr/testify/require)
   * Name the test `package X_test` to make ensure the code gets tested through the public API. See [this issue](https://github.com/tendermint/coding/issues/4) for background.
 * For Bash testing:
   * Checkout [shunit2](https://github.com/kward/shunit2) and [bats](https://github.com/sstephenson/bats)
   * In general, bash testing should be kept to a minimum.

## Errors

 * Make use of [pkg/errors](https://github.com/pkg/errors) for stack tracing if you have set a `--debug` option in your application
 * UP FOR DISCUSSION: To maximize code portability wherever possible check errors in place and return them, aka. do not hand off to another function for checking and exiting (for example `ExitOnErr(err error)`

## Config

 * Currently the TOML filetype is being used for config files
 * A good practice is to store the default Config file under `~/.[yourAppName]/config.toml`
 * Implement your config setup with [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper)

## CLI

 * When implementing a CLI use [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) and [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper). urfave/cli can be replace with cobra in those repos where applicable.
 * Wherever possible return errors instread of exiting the application. This allows for the application optionally
 print a stack trace of the error if a `--debug` flag is used with your application, which is probably a good idea.
 * By default to not print a full error stack trace for applications, but only print an error
 * Instead of using pointer flags (eg. `FlagSet().StringVar`) use viper to retrieve flag values (eg. `viper.GetString`)
   - The flag key used when setting and getting the flag should always be stored in a
   variable taking the form `FlagXxx` or `flagXxx`.
   - Flag short variable descriptions should always start with a lower case charater as to remain consistent with
   the description provided in the default `--help` flag.

## Version

 * Every repo should have a version/version.go file that mimicks the tendermint core repo
 * We read the value of the constant version in our build scripts and hence it has to be a string

## Non-Golang Code

 * All non-go code (`*.proto`, `Makefile`, `*.sh`), where there is no common
   agreement on style, should be formatted according to
   [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) config:

   ```
   # top-most EditorConfig file
   root = true

   # Unix-style newlines with a newline ending every file
   [*]
   charset = utf-8
   end_of_line = lf
   insert_final_newline = true
   trim_trailing_whitespace = true

   [Makefile]
   indent_style = tab

   [*.sh]
   indent_style = tab

   [*.proto]
   indent_style = space
   indent_size = 2
   ```

   Make sure the file above (`.editorconfig`) are in the root directory of your
   repo and you have a [plugin for your
   editor](http://editorconfig.org/#download) installed.
